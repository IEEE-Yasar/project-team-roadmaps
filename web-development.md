- * Even though this playlist is one of my favorites, it is based on a visual library called p5.js which is great for educational purposes but not commonly used. If you don't want to get into that, you can just skip this playlist.

## 3 - Responsive Frontend Development

We have developed a website with functionalities üñ•Ô∏è. However our website is not "responsive". In simple words, responsiveness is the act of developing websites in such a way that they are usable and look pretty in every screen-size. Making mobile-friendly websites is one of the most important topics of our nowaday web experience.

## 4 - Back-end Development with Node.js

You've come a long way. After exploring and developing your skills on front-end development, It's time to get into back-end development. We will use Node.js, It's basically Javascript that works on servers. First thing you need to do is downloading Node.js. Check out these free awesome tutorials about Node.js.

## 5 - Frameworks - Optional

After this much effort and practice, you might want to continue with more complex technologies which is currently used in FANG companies üò±. This part is optional and advised to developers who really want to choose web development as a career.

Frameworks are basically over-engineered libraries which take more control over your app flow. And as in every topic, there are huge discussion on the best framework. We usually use React.js on our project which is developed and currently maintained by Facebook.

- * The last course also have a paid version available that i have taken 1.5 years ago. However, they don't apply regional pricing to Turkey. So for the interested ones, i would recommend finding a different course.
