- * Even though this playlist is one of my favorites, it is based on a visual library called p5.js which is great for educational purposes but not commonly used. If you don't want to get into that, you can just skip this playlist.

# PROJECT 2
In this Project you're going to develop a Dice rolling game. With each time ou refresh the website you're going to roll a 6 sided dice. The result is going to be shown in the screen with the appropriate image of a dice. Here is an example.

## 3 - Responsive Frontend Development

We have developed a website with functionalities üñ•Ô∏è. However our website is not "responsive". In simple words, responsiveness is the act of developing websites in such a way that they are usable and look pretty in every screen-size. Making mobile-friendly websites is one of the most important topics of our nowaday web experience.

## 4 - Backend Development with Node.js

You've come a long way. After exploring and developing your skills on front-end development, It's time to get into back-end development. We will use Node.js, It's basically Javascript that works on servers. First thing you need to do is downloading Node.js. Check out these free awesome tutorials about Node.js.

# PROJECT 4
Lets gooo! You've really learned a lot during this journey. Now you will develop a weather report application. You're going to use [OpenWeatherMapAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api) which is a free API to get weather information of any country. We want you to develop a web application that fetches data of a inputed city and displays the weather information at the website. Here is how it might look like.

## 5 - Frameworks - React

After this much effort and practice, you might want to continue with more complex technologies which is currently used in FANG companies üò±. This part is optional and advised to developers who really want to choose web development as a career.

Frameworks are basically over-engineered libraries which take more control over your app flow. And as in every topic, there are huge discussion on the best framework. We usually use React.js on our project which is developed and currently maintained by Facebook.

- * The last course also have a paid version available that i have taken 1.5 years ago. However, they don't apply regional pricing to Turkey. So for the interested ones, i would recommend finding a different course.

# PROJECT 5
Now you've seen how React can help us build massive web applications, we're going to build a ToDO app with React. We're going to use components as much as possible for this project. Here is how it might look like

## 6 - Database - MySQL or MongoDB
Ok we're in the end game now. We've seen many frontend and backend technologies. Now we're going to see how we can store our data using a databse. There are two options, an non-relational database called MongoDB (Recommended) or a relational database called MySQL.

- [MongoDB in 100 secs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bt_y4Loofg)
- [MongoDB in 30 mins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWbMrx5rVBE)
- [MySQL in 3 hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S_tz1z_5bA)

# PROJECT 6 ToDo Database
Now we have learned about databases. Our final project will be adding a database to our ToDo app.
